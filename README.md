## Car Price Prediction

Project developed using data from the Automobile Dataset whose objective is to perform an exploratory analysis of the data and build a Machine Learning model to predict the price variable.

The project was developed in the order of these three files below:

- data cleansing.ipynb
- data_analysis.ipynb
- data_processing.ipynb

Below are the main tasks performed in each file:

- data_cleaning.ipynb: Handle missing data, Fix data with incorrect types
- data_analysis.ipynb: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, and Selection
- data_processing.ipynb: Transformations in data for model training, model training, performance evaluation, and interpretation of results


The data is available on the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository: [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/10/automobile)
